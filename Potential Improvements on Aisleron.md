# Potential Improvements on Aisleron



## Shops management and aisle layout:

more direct aisle layout from 1D to 2D (grid display)



## Products management(list and stock position):

common product library for easy addition

other properties of products (image, brand, prize,size, special tag)

pre-grouped addition (I want to make bubble-tea by myself: milk, sugar, tea, bubble...)

smart image(bills) recognize or audio agent for adding the products



## Some new interfaces:

history(shops, products,consumption record)

-> use-up product prediction

->purchase recommendation 

->route schedule

->purchase weekly/monthly plan with budget
